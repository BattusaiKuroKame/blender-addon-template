# Blender Add-on Template
This is an empty template to help you organize your Blender Add-on code.

# What's the big deal?
I use my free time to create cool things and release them - for free - on my website, [www.aaronpowell.me](http://www.aaronpowell.me). 3D models, animations, pictures, code snippets, publications, you name it (the code for the website is even open-sourced)!

All of the resources you need to remake (or tinker around with) these projects are available to download, whether it's 3D files, image textures, videos, code, or text documents, and everything is made using free or completely open-source software so you have access to everything you need to follow along.

# How to download
Please don't fork this project if you want to make your own Blender Add-on's based on this template. Instead, download as a zip file or clone to your hard drive and copy + paste it into your own project.
    
    git clone https://github.com/maxnewton/blender-addon-template
    cp ./blender-addon-template/* /path/to/your/project/folder
